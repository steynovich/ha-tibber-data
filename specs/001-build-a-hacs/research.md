# Research Findings: HACS Compatible Tibber Data Integration

**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Phase**: 0 - Research and Requirements Resolution

## OAuth2 Client Registration Process

### Decision: Contact-Based Registration Required
- **What was chosen**: Manual contact with Tibber support for OAuth2 client registration
- **Rationale**: OAuth2 clients for third-party applications require manual approval through Tibber's support team, not self-service registration
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Personal access tokens (self-service but only for personal use)
  - Bypassing OAuth2 (not viable for multi-user integration)

### Implementation Details:
- **Registration Process**: Contact Tibber via chat or email at developer.tibber.com
- **Required Information**: App description, redirect URIs, required scopes
- **Scopes Needed**: USER, HOME, real-time consumption (if applicable)
- **Rate Limits**: 100 requests per 5 minutes per IP address
- **Security Requirements**: HTTPS redirect URIs mandatory

## Device State Refresh Frequency

### Decision: 30-60 Second Polling with Push Support
- **What was chosen**: Default 60-second polling interval with async coordinator pattern
- **Rationale**: Balances user experience with API rate limits (100 req/5min) and follows HA best practices
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Real-time WebSocket subscriptions (limited device support)
  - Fixed 30-second polling (more aggressive, higher API usage)
  - User-configurable intervals (added complexity)

### Implementation Details:
- **Default Interval**: 60 seconds via DataUpdateCoordinator
- **Optimization**: Use `_async_setup()` for one-time initialization data
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper backoff strategies for API failures
- **Future Enhancement**: Support WebSocket subscriptions where available

## Home Assistant Integration Patterns

### Decision: Modern Coordinator-Based Architecture
- **What was chosen**: DataUpdateCoordinator with CoordinatorEntity pattern (HA 2024.8+ features)
- **Rationale**: Follows current HA Platinum standards, provides efficient async operation and proper error handling
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Legacy polling entities (deprecated)
  - Custom update mechanisms (unnecessary complexity)

### Key Patterns:
- **Entity Framework**: Use EntityDescription for declarative definitions
- **OAuth2 Flow**: AbstractOAuth2FlowHandler with PKCE support
- **Device Discovery**: Device registry integration with proper hierarchy
- **Testing**: pytest-homeassistant-custom-component framework
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance with strict mode

## HACS Publishing Requirements

### Decision: Full HACS Compatibility with Automated Validation
- **What was chosen**: Complete HACS-compliant structure with GitHub Actions validation
- **Rationale**: Ensures easy user installation and maintains quality standards through automation
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Manual distribution (poor user experience)
  - Partial HACS compliance (validation failures)

### Required Components:
- **Core Files**: hacs.json, manifest.json, proper directory structure
- **Automation**: HACS validation, hassfest validation, automated releases
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with installation instructions
- **Quality Gates**: All validation checks must pass before release

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Language and Dependencies
- **Python Version**: 3.11+ (Home Assistant compatibility)
- **Core Dependencies**:
  - `homeassistant` (core platform)
  - `aiohttp` (async HTTP client)
  - No additional external dependencies to maintain HACS compliance

### Performance and Quality Standards
- **Async Operations**: Fully async codebase for optimal HA performance
- **Type Coverage**: Complete type annotations with mypy strict compliance
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with integration and unit tests
- **Documentation**: Clear inline documentation and user guides

## API Integration Strategy

### Data Model Approach
- **Entity Hierarchy**: Homes → Devices → Capabilities → Attributes
- **State Management**: Coordinator-managed updates with push notifications where supported
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling with user-friendly error messages

### Security Considerations
- **Token Management**: Secure OAuth2 token storage and refresh handling
- **API Keys**: No hardcoded credentials, secure configuration flow
- **Data Privacy**: Minimal data retention, respect user privacy preferences

## Implementation Readiness

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the specification have been resolved:

1. ✅ **OAuth2 client registration**: Contact Tibber support required
2. ✅ **Device state refresh frequency**: 60-second polling with coordinator pattern
3. ✅ **Integration patterns**: Modern coordinator-based architecture identified
4. ✅ **HACS requirements**: Complete compatibility framework established

**Next Phase**: Ready to proceed with detailed design and contract creation (Phase 1)
