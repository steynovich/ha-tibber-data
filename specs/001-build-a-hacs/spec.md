# Feature Specification: HACS Compatible Tibber Data Integration for Home Assistant

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-hacs`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a HACS compatible integration for Home Assistant that leverages the Tibber Data API. Documentation of the API can be found here: https://data-api.tibber.com/docs/. The plugin should meet the Platinum quality scale (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/#-platinum). Also include GitHub actions as listed here https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/publish/action/"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature: HACS integration for Tibber Data API with Platinum quality
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Home Assistant users, Tibber device owners
   ’ Actions: Device discovery, data monitoring, state updates
   ’ Data: IoT device states, capabilities, history
   ’ Constraints: HACS compatibility, Platinum quality standards
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: OAuth2 client configuration method]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Device update frequency preferences]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary: Auto-discover and monitor Tibber-connected devices
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ OAuth2 authentication, device discovery, real-time updates
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Tibber Homes, Devices, Device States, Capabilities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding OAuth setup"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Home Assistant user with Tibber-connected IoT devices (electric vehicles, chargers, thermostats, solar inverters, batteries) wants to automatically discover and monitor these devices within their Home Assistant dashboard without manual configuration. They want real-time access to device states, capabilities, and historical data to create automations and track energy usage patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has Tibber account with connected devices, **When** they install the integration through HACS, **Then** all their Tibber homes and associated devices appear automatically in Home Assistant
2. **Given** the integration is configured with valid OAuth2 credentials, **When** a new device is added to their Tibber account, **Then** the device appears in Home Assistant within the refresh interval
3. **Given** a Tibber device changes state (e.g., EV charging status), **When** the state change occurs, **Then** Home Assistant reflects the updated state for use in automations
4. **Given** a user wants to view historical data, **When** they access device history, **Then** they can see past states and usage patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when OAuth2 credentials expire or become invalid?
- How does system handle temporary API outages or network connectivity issues?
- What occurs when a device is removed from the Tibber account?
- How are conflicting device IDs or duplicate devices handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST authenticate with Tibber Data API using OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically discover all homes associated with the authenticated Tibber account
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically discover all devices within each Tibber home
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time access to device states, attributes, and capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST support device history retrieval for trend analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle device connectivity status and firmware information
- **FR-007**: System MUST respect API rate limits and implement efficient polling strategies
- **FR-008**: System MUST be installable through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
- **FR-009**: Integration MUST meet Home Assistant Platinum quality scale requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide automatic GitHub Actions validation for HACS compatibility
- **FR-011**: System MUST be fully asynchronous for optimal Home Assistant performance
- **FR-012**: System MUST include comprehensive type annotations and documentation
- **FR-013**: System MUST support UI-based reconfiguration of OAuth2 credentials
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide automated test coverage for all functionality
- **FR-015**: OAuth2 client registration MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: self-service through Tibber developer portal or requires manual approval?]
- **FR-016**: Device state refresh frequency MUST be [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: configurable by user or fixed interval?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tibber Home**: Represents a user's physical location with associated devices, contains home ID and basic metadata
- **Tibber Device**: IoT devices connected through Tibber platform (EVs, chargers, thermostats, etc.), contains device identity, capabilities, and current state
- **Device Capabilities**: Available functions and current state values with units (e.g., charging power, temperature, battery level)
- **Device Attributes**: Metadata including connectivity status, firmware versions, and external identifiers
- **OAuth2 Session**: Authentication session for accessing Tibber Data API with proper scope permissions
